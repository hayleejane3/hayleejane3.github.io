    <a href = "http://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank">WACM</a> is the name of the University of Wisconsin - Madison's chapter of <a href = "https://women.acm.org/" target = "_blank">ACM-W</a>(ACM's Women in Computing), and comprises of female students in the Computer Sciences Department at the undergraduate, graduate as well as PhD level. The organization works towards inspiring women to take up the Computer Science major while also creating a fostering enviroment for the personal, academic, and professional development of its members. As an undergraduate repesentative of the organization I have helped coordinate multiple events that have been conducted with speakers, recruiters and other representatives from tech companies. This upcoming fall semester I also hope to be a mentor as part of WACM's Mentoring Program  and will speak with underclassmen about their experiences and interests in Computer Science and related disciplines and motivate them to further their career in the field.

    <h2>GHC 2016</h2>
    <div id = "ghc-content">
      The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in computing, more commonly known as <a href = "https://ghc.anitaborg.org/about/" target = "_blank">GHC</a> is the world's largest conference held for women technologists. I received a scholarship from WACM to attend the annual 3 day conference last October. The event provides participants with an amazing networking experience, a multitude of opportunites to learn about the technology industry and a change to greatly develop their technical skills among many other things. During the event last year I attended a number of talks held by notable experts in technical fields spanning the industry, academia as well as government. On one of the days I also participated in a workshop amd learned to develo an application for the Apple Watch. One of the biggest highlights of the conference for me however, was being able to meet and connect with so many extraordinary women, and men, who have careers in such a range of technical disciplines. I was especially appreciative of being able to converse with people from the industry not onlyh at the large career fair held at the convention center, but also at the events held by companies after the day long session at the actual conference. The entire experience will remain etched in my memory for a while, and I hope to be an attendee at this year's celebration as well!

    <h2>QWCC</h2>

    <br/>
    Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference(<a href = "https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2016/02/19/inspiring-college-women-engaged-engineering-degrees" target = "_blank">QWCC</a>) is an annual conference hosted by Qualcomm, a telecommunications and semi-conductor company, for female underclassmen studying Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. Not one of the popular events held to encourage the involvement of women in technical fields, they only accept nominations from recruiters or past attendees and select just 60 students from universities across the US. The conference was held over 4 days at Qualcomm's head quarters in San Diego, and included technical workshops, networking events, techincal skill-building activities, professional development sessions, as well as informational talks about the company. We also had the opportunity to hear from the company's CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, and try out some of the exciting projects that were being developed there like those based on augmented reality and image recognition. Moreover, we got to meet with middle school girls from the area and have a hackathon with them where we worked on building an Android application that worked with an Arduino, and talk to them about what its like to be studying in such an impactful field where women are a minority.
