    <a href = "http://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank">WACM</a> is the name of the University of Wisconsin - Madison's chapter of <a href = "https://women.acm.org/" target = "_blank">ACM-W</a>(ACM's Women in Computing), and comprises of female students in the Computer Sciences Department at the undergraduate, graduate as well as PhD level. The organization works towards inspiring women to take up the Computer Science major while also creating a fostering enviroment for the personal, academic, and professional development of its members. As an undergraduate repesentative and mentoring co-chair of the organization I have helped coordinate multiple events that have been conducted with speakers, recruiters and other representatives from tech companies. I am also a mentor as part of WACM's Mentoring Program and hope to speak with underclassmen about their experiences and interests in Computer Science and related disciplines and motivate them to further their career in the field.

    <h2>GHC 2016</h2>
    <div id = "conf-content">
      The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in computing, more commonly known as <a href = "https://ghc.anitaborg.org/about/" target = "_blank">GHC</a> is the world's largest conference held for women technologists. I received a scholarship from WACM to attend the annual 3 day conference last October. The event provides participants with an amazing networking experience, a multitude of opportunites to learn about the technology industry and a change to greatly develop their technical skills among many other things. During the event last year I attended a number of talks held by notable experts in technical fields spanning the industry, academia as well as government. On one of the days I also participated in a workshop amd learned to develop an application for the Apple Watch. One of the biggest highlights of the conference for me however, was being able to meet and connect with so many extraordinary women, and men, who have careers in such a range of technical disciplines. I was especially appreciative of being able to converse with people from the industry not only at the large career fair held at the convention center, but also at the events held by companies after the day long session at the actual conference.

    Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference(<a href = "https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2016/02/19/inspiring-college-women-engaged-engineering-degrees" target = "_blank">QWCC</a>) is an annual conference hosted by Qualcomm, a telecommunications and semi-conductor company, for female underclassmen studying Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. Not one of the popular events held to encourage the involvement of women in technical fields, they only accept nominations from recruiters or past attendees and select just 60 students from universities across the US. The conference was held over 4 days at Qualcomm's head quarters in San Diego, and included technical workshops, networking events, techincal skill-building activities, professional development sessions, as well as informational talks about the company. We also had the opportunity to hear from the company's CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, and try out some of the exciting projects that were being developed there like those based on augmented reality and image recognition. Moreover, we got to meet with middle school girls from the area and have a hackathon with them where we worked on building an Android application that worked with an Arduino, and talk to them about what its like to be studying in such an impactful field where women are a minority.

      The GWE(Google Women Engineers) Summit is an annual two-day summit held at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, CA for their female interns. The event allowed me to interact with influential women at Google with whom I spoke not only about technical topics, but also those that would help us grow as women in this field. I also participated in a leadership skills development session, which I'm sure will be useful to me as I further my career. The talk on Machine Learning at Google was another highlight of the event.

      <h2>GHC 2017</h2>

      This year I received a travel grant from Google to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration held in Orlando. An event I really enjoyed this year was a session I attended on Natural Language Processing. I was also able to participate in the coveted GHC talk on how to negotiate in your career, be it a salary or getting a job opportunity. I did quite a bit of party-hopping this year too, and attended afterparties hosted by Cisco, Twitter, Ebay, Google as well as Allstate! Moreover, I got a chance to catch up with old friends and make some new ones too. The entire experience will remain etched in my memory for a while, and I hope to be an attendee at next year's celebration as well.
