      I am Haylee, a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison doing an honors major in Computer Science with a certificate in Mathematics. I am exploring the different areas of the discipline and have taken high level courses in Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Machine Organization, Operating Systems and Database Management Systems, as well as Graduate Human-Computer Interaction.  When I graduate this May, I will be joining Google full-time as a Software Engineer on one of their Search teams at their headquarters in Mountain View, California.

      <br><br>This past summer I interned at Google where I added an improvement to the offline experience of Google's Search App for Android. I also did an internship at Google in the summer of 2016 where I worked on the interface of Google Drive’s Share dialog in JavaScript as well as developed a new feature for Inbox, the sleeker version of Gmail. In Spring 2017 I interned at Lucid Software where I worked on an array of projects, including one that involved setting up a server to handle changes made to Lucidchart subscriptions through it’s new AWS Marketplace listing.

      <br><br>Outside of class I am working at the Wisconsin HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) lab on a project that involves improving human contol of robots used in manufactoring. I also previously did some work on a data-driven web application, <a href = "https://movie-stop.herokuapp.com" target = "_blank">Movie Stop</a> which serves as a search engine for movies and related information. It also includes different user authentication levels, and the ability for users to add data into the database. On my own time I also worked on an Android application which allows users to follow particular Twitter hashtags of their choice, and receive notifications for any new posts which include that hashtag.

      <br><br>I am a strong supporter of increasing diversity in the workforce as well as the participation of women in technical fields, and am an activities co-chair and mentor at <a href = "http://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank">WACM</a>, my university’s chapter of ACM-W(ACM's Women in Computing). I inititate and organize events with notable representatives from technology companies, create presentations for members on developmental topics like Networking, as well as mentor underclassmen.

      <br><br>In recognition of my academic excellence and potential for success, I was awarded a scholarship from the university's Computer Science department. I also received scholarships from Google and WACM to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2017 and 2016 respectively, and was one of the 60 female underclassmen selected from across the US to attend the Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference in January 2016.
