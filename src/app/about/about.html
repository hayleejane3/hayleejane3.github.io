      I am Haylee, a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison doing an honors major in Computer Science with a certificate in Mathematics. I am exploring the different areas of the discipline and has taken high level courses in Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Machine Organization, as well as Operating Systems.

      <br><br>This past summer I interned at Google where I added an improvement to the offline experience of Google's Search App for Android. I also did an internship at Google last summer where I worked on the interface of Google Drive’s Share dialog in JavaScript as well as developed a new feature for Inbox. In Spring 2017 I interned at Lucid Software where I worked on an array of projects, including one that involved setting up a server to handle changes made to Lucidchart subscriptions through it’s new AWS Marketplace listing.

      <br><br>Outside of class I am working at the Wisconsin HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) lab on a project that involves shared control between a robot and a human. I also previously did some work on an Android application which allows users to follow particular Twitter hashtags of their choice and receive notifications for any new posts which include that hashtag.

      <br><br>I am a strong supporter of increasing diversity in the workforce as well as the participation of women in technical fields, and am an undergraduate representative and mentor at <a href = "http://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank">WACM</a>, the university’s chapter of ACM-W(ACM's Women in Computing) where I help organize events with notable representatives from technology companies, as well as mentor underclassmen. I was also a recipient of a scholarship from the organization to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2016, and one of the 60 female underclassmen selected from across the US to attend the Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference in January 2016.
